\subsection{Problem Description}

Given a list of unique, uppercase names, determine if the list is completely
in increasing alphabetical order, completely decreasing alphabetically, or
neither.
\subsection{Algorithm}

We can rely on Java's built-in String.compareTo function to solve this. First,
we will get the result of compareTo between the 2nd and first list elements.

Then, for every other adjacent pair of strings, we can verify that the result
of compareTo is on the same side of 0 as the initial comparison (i.e. they must
be either both positive or both negative). If it isn't, the answer is neither.
If however, the second value is larger than the first for all pairs, we are
ascending. Finally, if the second value is smaller than the first for all pairs,
we are descending.

Where \textit{L} is the length of the longest string.
